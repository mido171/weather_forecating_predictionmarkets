# WX-207 — Distribution builder: integer-temperature probabilities + Kalshi bin probabilities from μ̂/σ̂

## Objective
Given μ̂(T) and σ̂(T), compute:
- probability for each integer temperature value
- probability for configured Kalshi bins (e.g., 81–82)

## Requirements
- Implement integer discretization:
  - P(Tmax = k) = CDF(k+0.5) - CDF(k-0.5) under Normal(μ̂, σ̂)
- Implement bin aggregation:
  - P(bin a–b) = sum_{k=a..b} P(Tmax=k)
- Must support configurable integer range (e.g., 40..110 default)
- Must return a normalized distribution (sum to 1 within range; track tail mass).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Distribution sums to 1 within tolerance when including tail handling.
- [ ] Bin probabilities sum to 1 across a complete partition of bins.
- [ ] Unit tests validate probability mass logic on simple numeric examples.
